# Chapter 2: Plot

## Slide 1: Story vs Plot

- **Story** = events in chronological order; changes of state in storyworld. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- **Plot** (or emplotment) = how narrator arranges those events: order, causality, duration, prominence. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- Example: George → dragon → rescue → marriage. The story may simply list them; plot arranges with cause / reordering. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

## Slide 2: Diagrams of Plot‑Operations

![Fig. 2.2 – Events in time only](/images/fig2_2.png)  
![Fig. 2.3 – Events with time + cause](/images/fig2_3.png)  
![Fig. 2.4 – Altered order, cause + reordering](/images/fig2_4.png)  

- **Fig 2.2**: Events only ordered in time; no explicit causality emphasized. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- **Fig 2.3**: Adds causal links between events (curved lines). :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
- **Fig 2.4**: Reordering via the narrator: begins with wedding, then explains preceding events. Plot ≠ story. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

## Slide 3: Emplotment — Key Operations

| Operation     | What it Modifies                             | Purpose / Effect                                      |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Order**      | Chronological vs flashback / in medias res    | Changes suspense, relevance of events                 |
| **Duration**   | How much narrative time devoted to events     | Compression / expansion to focus or de‐emphasize      |
| **Frequency**  | Repetition, iteration, or collapse of events   | Reinforce themes or highlight patterns                |
| **Connection** | How causally or thematically events are linked | Makes plot coherent or emphasizes causal structure     |
| **Relevance**  | What is included / omitted, what is emphasised | Controls focus, reader expectations                   |

- These are the tools that convert a raw story into a plot. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

## Slide 4: Structure & Conflict

- Many plots use **beginning**, **middle**, **end** structures to build coherence. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
- **Conflict**: external (e.g. danger, characters) or internal (psychological, moral). :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  
- **Resolution** often follows conflict: might be success, failure, or complex/ambiguous outcome. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  

---

## Slide 5: Suspense & Surprise

- **Suspense**: when the reader anticipates something, knows more than characters, or foresees potential outcome. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}  
- **Surprise**: something unexpected, reversal, twist. Depends on what is withheld or released. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}  
- Emplotment choices (order, duration, etc.) strongly affect how suspense & surprise work. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}

## Slide 6: Freytag’s Pyramid & Alternative Plot Models

![Fig. 2.9 – Freytag’s Pyramid](/images/fig2_9.png)

- Freytag’s model: exposition → rising action → climax → falling action → resolution. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}  
- Alternative models: growth, journey, illumination; plots that do *not* resolve neatly. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}  

---

## Slide 7: Illustrative Examples & Figures

- **Fig 2.5**: *St. George and the Dragon* — classic conflict motif. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}  
- **Fig 2.1**: Bust of Aristotle – invoking the classical tradition of plot theory. :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}  
- **Fig 2.6‑2.8**: Robinson Crusoe, Hansel & Gretel, Oedipus & the Sphinx – examples of plot structures and dramatic conflict. :contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}  

---

## Slide 8: Summary & Key Takeaways

- Story ≠ Plot; plot is crafted via emplotment.  
- Emplotment tools: order, duration, frequency, connection, relevance.  
- Conflict + resolution remain central, but are not universally dominant.  
- Suspense & surprise deployed through narrative techniques.  
- Freytag’s pyramid as classic template; alternatives exist.

## Slide 9: Questions for Discussion

1. Identify a novel/story and map its events: what is the story, and how has the plot rearranged them?  
2. How does a non‑chronological order affect suspense or surprise in your favorite novel?  
3. In what ways does relevance (what is included vs omitted) guide reader interpretation or misinterpretation?
